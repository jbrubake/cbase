* docs/cbaserc.5: Created basic manpage for cbaserc

2011-05-19 Jeremy Brubaker <jbru362@gmail.com>

* Reorganized project structure and basically started from scratch

2011-05-24 Jeremy Brubaker <jbru362@gmail.com>

* cbase/kazlib_wrapper.h: Deleted. Moved functionality to except.h

* cbase/except.h: Created a sensible TRY/CATCH framework for kazlib

* cbase/Makefile: Now properly cleans coredumps on Windows

Wrote macros so you can use kazlib's exception handling in a sensible
way. This required some loss of flexibility as you can no longer catch
specific exceptions, but you can handle specific exceptions in the CATCH
block. An unhandled exception can then be rethrown and caught by the
next enclosing TRY/CATCH block.

* cbase/Makefile, pkgfiles/Makefile: Now respects environment settings for common
variables

* cbase/xmalloc.h: Cleaned up #include's

* cbase/xstring.h: Fixed incorrect function parameters

Build system now respects environment settings for CC and LD and
only appends to CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
