* Reorganized project structure and basically started from scratch

* kazlib_wrapper.h: Deleted. Moved functionality to except.h

* except.h: Created a sensible TRY/CATCH framework for kazlib

* Makefile: Now properly cleans coredumps on Windows

Wrote macros so you can use kazlib's exception handling in a sensible
way. This required some loss of flexibility as you can no longer catch
specific exceptions, but you can handle specific exceptions in the CATCH
block. An unhandled exception can then be rethrown and caught by the
next enclosing TRY/CATCH block.

* bstrlib.[ch]: Added

* xstring.h: Deleted

Instead of rolling my own string routines cbase will use the Better String
Library.

* module.mk: Removed old files and added new ones

* cbase.h error.c, logfile.c, util.c, xtime.c: Changed all references to
cstrings with bstrings

Previous commit added the bstring library, but I didn't adjust anything to
actually use it
